"Chang, YH; Chang, CY; Tseng, YH","ISI:000279714800001","samtseng@ntu.edu.tw","Trends of Science Education Research: An Automatic Content Analysis. This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, and Science Education from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000's. The studies in the themes of Professional Development, Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues, and Conceptual Chang and Analogy were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science."

Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLIM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901.446 in total) for SLIM Instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stones, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion. "
"Tseng, YH","ISI:000272846500049","samtseng@ntu.edu.tw","Generic title labeling for clustered documents. Document clustering is a powerful technique to detect topics and their relations for information browsing, analysis, and organization. However, clustered documents require post-assignment of descriptive titles to help users interpret the results. Existing techniques often assign labels to clusters based only on the terms that the clustered documents contain, which may not be sufficient for some applications. To solve this problem, a cluster labeling algorithm for creating generic titles, based on external resources Such as WordNet, is proposed. Our method first extracts category-specific terms as cluster descriptors. These descriptors are then mapped to generic terms based on a hypernyrn search algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated on a patent document collection and a subset of the Reuters-21578 collection. Experimental results revealed that our method performs as anticipated. Real-case applications of these generic terms show promising in assisting humans in interpreting the clustered topics. Our method is general enough such that it can be easily extended to use other hierarchical resources for adaptable label generation. "
"Tseng, YH; Lin, YI; Lee, YY; Hung, WC; Lee, CH","ISI:000270841800006","samtseng@ntu.edu.tw","A comparison of methods for detecting hot topics. In scientometrics for trend analysis, parameter choices for observing trends are often made ad hoc in past studies. For examples, different year spans might be used to create the time sequence and different indices were chosen for trend observation. However, the effectiveness of these choices was hardly known, quantitatively and comparatively. This work provides clues to better interpret the results when a certain choice was made. Specifically, by sorting research topics in decreasing order of interest predicted by a trend index and then by evaluating this ordering based on information retrieval measures, we compare a number of trend indices (percentage of increase vs. regression slope), trend formulations (simple trend vs. eigen-trend), and options (various year spans and durations for prediction) in different domains (safety agriculture and information retrieval) with different collection scales (72500 papers vs. 853 papers) to know which one leads to better trend observation. Our results show that the slope of linear regression on the time series performs constantly better than the others. More interestingly, this index is robust under different conditions and is hardly affected even when the collection was split into arbitrary (e.g., only two) periods. Implications of these results are discussed. Our work does not only provide a method to evaluate trend prediction performance for scientometrics, but also provides insights and reflections for past and future trend observation studies."

Patent documents contain important research results. They are often collectively analyzed and organized in a visual way to support decision making. However, they are lengthy and rich in technical terminology, and thus require a lot of human effort for analysis. Automatic tools for assisting patent engineers or decision makers in patent analysis are in great demand. This paper describes a summarization method for patent surrogate extraction, intended to efficiently and effectively support patent mapping, which is an important sub-task of patent analysis. Six patent maps were used to evaluate its relative usefulness. The experimental results confirm that the machine generated summaries do preserve more important content words than some other patent sections or even than the full patent texts when only a few terms are to be considered for classification and mapping. The implication is that if one were to determine a patent's category based on only a few terms at a quick pace, one could begin by reading the section summaries generated automatically."
"Tseng, YH; Lin, CJ; Lin, YI","ISI:000246869800006","samtseng@ntu.edu.tw","Text mining techniques for patent analysis. Patent documents contain important research results. However, they are lengthy and rich in technical terminology such that it takes a lot of human efforts for analyses. Automatic tools for assisting patent engineers or decision makers in patent analysis are in great demand. This paper describes a series of text mining techniques that conforms to the analytical process used by patent analysts. These techniques include text segmentation, summary extraction, feature selection, term association, cluster generation, topic identification, and information mapping. The issues of efficiency and effectiveness are considered in the design of these techniques. Some important features of the proposed methodology include a rigorous approach to verify the usefulness of segment extracts as the document surrogates, a corpus- and dictionary-free algorithm for keyphrase extraction, an efficient co-word analysis method that can be applied to large volume of patents, and an automatic procedure to create generic cluster titles for ease of result interpretation. Evaluation of these techniques was conducted. The results confirm that the machine-generated summaries do preserve more important content words than some other sections for classification. To demonstrate the feasibility, the proposed methodology was applied to a realworld patent set for domain analysis and mapping, which shows that our approach is more effective than existing classification systems. The attempt in this paper to automate the whole process not only helps create final patent maps for topic analyses, but also facilitates or improves other patent analysis tasks such as patent classification, organization, knowledge sharing, and prior art searches.

"Tseng, YH","ISI:000178776600007","samtseng@ntu.edu.tw","Automatic thesaurus generation for Chinese documents. This article reports an approach to automatic thesaurus construction for Chinese documents. An effective Chinese keyword extraction algorithm is first presented. Experiments showed that for each document an average of 33% keywords unknown to a lexicon of 123,226 terms could be identified by this algorithm. Of these unregistered words, only 8.3% of them are illegal. Keywords extracted from each document are further filtered for term association analysis. Association weights larger than a threshold are then accumulated over all the documents to yield the final term pair similarities. Compared to previous studies, this method speeds up the thesaurus generation process drastically. It also achieves a similar percentage level of term relatedness."

This article describes our efforts in supporting information retrieval from OCR degraded text, In particular, we report our approach to an automatic cataloging and searching contest for books in multiple languages. In this contest, 500 books in English, German, French, and Italian published during the 1770s to 1970s are scanned into images and OCRed to digital text. The goal is to use only automatic ways to extract information for sophisticated searching. We adopted the vector space retrieval model, an n-gram indexing method, and a special weighting scheme to tackle this problem. Although the performance by this approach is slightly inferior to the best approach, which is mainly based on regular expression match, one advantage of our approach is that it is less language dependent and less layout sensitive, thus is readily applicable to other languages and document collections. Problems of OCR text retrieval for some Asian languages are also discussed in this article, and solutions are suggested."

A number of cyclic and BCH code decoders that have 0(1) time complexity and less hardware complexity than conventional digital decoders are presented. The neural decoder is formulated as a set of parity networks in the first layer followed by a linear perceptron in the second layer, and thus has simple implementation in VLSI technology."

A class of neural network for constructing associative memories that learn the memory patterns as well as their neighbouring patterns is presented. The network is basically a layer of perceptrons with high-order polynomials as their discriminant functions. A learning algorithm is proposed for the network to learn arbitrary bipolar patterns. The simulation results show that the associative memories implemented in this way achieve a set of desirable characteristics, namely high storage capacity, nearest convergence, and existence of a 'no decision' state which attracts indistinguishable inputs. Furthermore, it is also possible to shape the attraction basin of a memory pattern under any metrics definition of distance."
